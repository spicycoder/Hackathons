# Reports

Once executed, you can see it generates a HTML file, inside StrykerOutput directory

Note that, this output path can be customized, if required.

You can also choose to generate various reporting formating, such as HTML, Markdown, Clear Text, JSON and more

When I serve the generated HTML report, I can see a detailed report on how many mutants were create, how many of them were killed and how many of them survived.

I can drill down to a specific file, and take a closer look.

In this case, I see that the log message statement was not covered. As a consequence, if someone modify the message in the logger, or if it is completely removed altogether, no one would know.

This might appear to be not so critical, in the beginning.

But if the log message is specifically tracked by Observability system, say to keep track of a `Metric`, like how many times, a specific message is published over a queue, there will be a significant impact, if that information is lost.
