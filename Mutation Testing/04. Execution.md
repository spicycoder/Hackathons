# Execution

Once installed, you can restore it anytime, just like nuget packages, by executing

```sh
dotnet tool restore
```

Then run the command `dotnet stryker`

In my case, I am going to add a reporting argument, so I can generate a HTML report

```sh
dotnet stryker -r "html"
```

Note that, unlike unit tests, Mutation testing will take longer time. It is advisable to run it as a separate nightly build.
