# Mutation Testing

Imagine the following scenario.

I write a simple C# method, to add 2 numbers.

```cs
public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
```

And I write unit test, to provide code coverage to the `Add` method

```cs
[Test]
public void Add_2And2_Returns4()
{
    // Arrange
    var operations = new Operations();

    // Act
    var result = operations.Add(0, 0);

    // Assert
    Assert.That(result, Is.EqualTo(0));
}
```

Note that, this simple test will provide 100% code coverage.

But imagine, another developer causes a regression, at much later point in time, replacing `+` with `-`

```cs
public double Add(double a, double b) => a - b;
```

Now, the test we have, would still pass. Because, they were not good enough to spot regression bugs.

Of course, this example is very simple, so it is very obvious to spot. But the point is, this happens more frequent in enterprise projects than you think.

## Stryker

These undesired code changes are called `Mutations`

We will have to intentionally mutate the code and run all the tests, to see, if our tests still holds good enough to kill the mutants.

The number of mutant survivors show how poor the tests are.

Fortunately, we don't have to change the code with all possible combination and run the tests several times.

There is a convenient open source tool - `Stryker`.

Stryker works with `.NET`, `JavaScript` / `TypeScript` and `Scala`.

For our demo, we are going to use it with .NET projects.
