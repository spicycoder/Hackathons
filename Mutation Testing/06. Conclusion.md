# Conclusion

The simplicity of mutation testing is that, it can be simply executed as a separate nightly build, without impacting the existing CI pipelines.

Most importantly, we don't have to run a refinement session, to get development team / QA efforts to make changes in the source code to accommodate it.

It only takes small effort, to ensure future proof tests.

We are hoping this package will be approved and we can start using it into our projects.

Thanks for the opportunity, we will see you in the next one.

Until then, keep fighting the mutants.
