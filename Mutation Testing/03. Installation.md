# Installation

`Stryker` can be installed in 2 ways, for testing .NET projects.

Install as a global dotnet tool

```sh
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-stryker
```

Or, install locally to the .NET repository

```sh
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install dotnet-stryker
```

We are following the later, so it can be executed easily from CI pipeline
