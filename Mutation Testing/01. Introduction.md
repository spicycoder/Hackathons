# Introduction

Most of the projects in Eurofins, have

1. Unit Testing
1. Integration Testing
1. Functional Testing
1. API Testing and 
1. UI Automation Testing

All the projects are integrated into `Sonar Qube` for quality gate

If the coverage falls below a specific range, say, less than 85%, the CI Pipeline will break the build

Sounds good. But have we ever tested the quality of the tests we write?

Sure, we perform code reviews. But there are automated ways to future proof our code.

I am `Prastuti`, and welcome to our hackathon project - `Mutation Testing using Stryker`. In next couple of minutes, `Prathima` and I will show how we can measure the quality of our tests and automate it using CI Pipelines.
