# Dynamic Evaluation

When the user is trying to convert the formula, say for a category - Density

Based on the Field they are trying to convert, we already can find from the database, which category it belongs to

Based on that, we can populate / suggest these relevant units to the users

Once the user selected a unit, to convert to. We dynamically evaluate the value, using the nuget package - `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting`
