# Introduction

With world class laboratories and leading Lab Information Management System, across the globe, we often face the need to convert unit of measures, based on various standards, across various countries.

Having an exhaustive list of units and their complex conversion formulas, is humanly impossible to build.

This is clearly a task for AI. Welcome to our Hackathon project - `Smart Scale`.

Where we build a Units Repository, that can accept custom units from users and also build a huge library of units, proactively using AI.
