# Collect Units

To collect the units that the users expect, we'll create a UI Component, where we let the user enter a their formula

We persist this formula into our database, so it can be used later, when needed

But this is limited to user interaction

In addition, we will also use AI to generate and populate most of the relevant formulas, ahead, so they'll be available to the users, out of the box
