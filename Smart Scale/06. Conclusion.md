# Conclusion

The idea is to make `Unit Conversion as a Service`, by exposing it as a REST API

Having 3 endpoints

1. Add custom unit
1. Read suggested units
1. Convert to selected Unit

And we want it to be loosely coupled with the AI Framework

Hence, we abstract it using `Microsoft.Extensions.AI` nuget package

We are open to questions, on our approach. Or dive deep into the code, if interested.

Thank you for the opportunity, see you again in another interesting Hackathon Idea.
