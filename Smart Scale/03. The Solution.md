# The Solution

We are trying to solve a couple of problems, in sequence

## 1. To collect the possible units that are relent for a given metric

This can be done in a couple of ways.

    1. Reach out to the users to add missing units, whenever they feel missing
    2. Proactively populate an exhaustive set of units, using AI

## 2. Dynamically evaluate the formula, on demand

This can be done in .NET using `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting` nuget package
