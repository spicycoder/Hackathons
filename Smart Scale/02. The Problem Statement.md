# The Problem Statement

Imagine the unit of measure of a liquid, in Europe.

Typically, for small quantity, it'll be `millie liters` and for larger quantity, it'll be `liters`

To measure the same, in other regions, say US, it'll be measured `ounces` for smaller quantity and in `gallons` for larger quantity

This is simple to convert, as only a multiplication factor is involved

Imagine, something like temperature, where a factor and offset is involved

For example, to convert `Celsius` to `Fahrenheit`

$$F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$$

This requires the repository to not only store the conversion factor

It should store the formula itself and evaluate it dynamically, on demand

The requirement gets more complicated, when combination of units are involved, such as `density is mass over volume`

```latex
density = mass / volume
```
